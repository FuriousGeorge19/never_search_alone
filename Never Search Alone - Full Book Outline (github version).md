## [Overview and Key Themes](#table-of-contents)

* What chapters to read based on your career/job search situation
* **<font color="#c00000"><span style="background:#fff88f">Emphasizes: The value of this book is from putting the recommendations into action….not reading</span></font>**
* First mention and stress of the importance of ‘Candidate-Market’ fit

### Overview

* Don’t start a job search  working on resume/LinkedIn. 
* Rather search with the support of a team (‘Job Search Council’) and determine your ‘Candidate-Market Fit’
* Determining your “Candidate-Market Fit” - The intersection between your hopes, dreams AND market realities. 
* **Listening Tour
    * Mentions the emotional challenge posed by the feedback you get in your ‘Listening Tour’
    * Also stresses the need to be ‘open-minded curious’ during that phase. 
    * 2-3 weeks if not working. Longer if working OR MAKING A MAJOR CAREER CHANGE
* **Candidate-Market Fit
    * You create it based on your research from the Listening Tour
    * It is challenging to create a practical, clear and focused statement
    * Whereas the Listening Tour is about being open-minded, the Candidate-Market Fit requires you to ‘box yourself in’
    * You can’t be open to everything or anything when you go to the next stage ‘Networking and Interviewing’
    * Strategy is about making hard choices and tradeoffs
    * No choice is more important in a job search than determining your Candidate-Market Fit
* **Networking and Interviewing
    * Prep for interviews by diving into strategy, financial strength, culture, products of target companies
    * Examine values, quality and history of leadership
    * Hard to do for high growth startups and private companies
    * Create a Job Mission with OKRs (“objectives and key results”) to clarify alignment, impress the manager and as a basis for negotiation. He says this is one of the most important tools in the book. 
* **Negotiating
    * Leverage your JSC, your Job Mission with OKRs to help negotiate:
        * Compensation
        * Budget
        * Resources
        * Support	


## Step 0: If You Just Left or Lost Your Job 

<br>

## Step 1: Set Up a Job Search Council

<br>

### [Chapter 1: Managing-the-Job-Search-Roller-Coaster](#table-of-contents)

* Emotional balance in a job search is critical to your persistence
* Everyone struggles with self doubt
* Job Search Council is a way to maintain and achieve that balance
* <font color="#f79646">Learning to ask for help is a key skill. It’s a skill over indexed on by  successful people</font>
* You’ll be asking for help  from your JSC, former colleagues, from your network and from recruiters
* Asking people for help builds a bond with them. Most people love to. 
  <br>
* Mutually Reinforcing Activity
    - <font color="#f79646">Insight: knowing how to grow or change often doesn’t result in change. Knowing isn’t enough. </font>
    - <font color="#f79646">Connection, not knowledge, is often the key to getting us to act. </font>
    - <font color="#f79646">Why peer councils, forums and mutual support groups are effective. </font>
      <br>
* The Wrong Way to Ask for Help
    * ‘Independent’ vs ‘Dependent’ forms of asking
    * ‘Independent’ means you’re looking for help trying to improve yourself. You do your homework and are self reliant. 
    * ‘Dependent’ - Asking but not learning. Learning but not changing your approach. 
      <br>
* High performers suffer from impostor syndrome the most
* Why JSC formed of ‘weak ties’: Often easier to speak about serious concerns w/people you know less well
  <br>
* Power of Weak Ties
    * They bring different perspectives and often distinct, non-overlapping networks
    * Often helpful in seeing the mistakes you can’t see yourself and the biases your succumbing to
    * Part of why some of the work in this book is paired with members of your JSC
      <br>
* Charlie Munger: _If a smart person goes into a room with an orangutan and explains whatever his or her idea is, the orangutan just sits there eating his banana, and at the end of the conversation, the person explaining comes out smarter_.

### [Chapter 2: Recruit-Strangers-(or-Acquaintances)](#table-of-contents)

* Most people (he says 80% of readers) have no trouble recruiting strangers
* First step: Find Your First Member (of your JSC)
* Ask people: “Who else do you know — at my level, more or less — who is looking for a job?”
* Other than level, he’s pretty open to recruiting any type of person. Different industries, genders, etc. All good. 
* But don’t mix people looking for new jobs while working w/those out of work. Fundamentally different pace of searches make them incompatible. 
- <font color="#f79646">If you have trouble: 1) ask for help from friends, colleagues, or others whom you trust; 2) go to PhylTerry.com and sign-up for my free JSC matching service.</font>
* What to Say to a Potential Recruit?
    * Tell them it’s to support each other in a job search
    * Tell them you’re using Never Search Alone as your guide
    * Tell them it’s a place to ask each other for help
    * Need a willingness to ask and to listen
    * Next..
      <br>
      
* After you get your first member, you can create your charter (he provides a template)
* He has three categories of focus: 
    * out-of-work job seekers
    * in-work job seekers
    * career-switchers
* <font color="#f79646">I don’t know if I’m #1 or #3. Probably #3.</font>
* When you have 4 people total or more, you’re ready to launch

### [Chapter 3: Launch your JSC](#table-of-contents)

* He provides standard meeting format and pointers for the first 10 meeting agendas
* Practical Issues:
  <br>
    * **Moderation**
        * As the founder, you should be the moderator
        * If everyone is reading the book, most people will go out of their way to help each other
        * <font color="#f79646">Three part meeting format</font>:
            * <font color="#f79646">Updates, including results of any individual homework exercises from the book </font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Short requests for help (RFHs)</font> 
            * <font color="#f79646">Long RFHs and joint exercises from the book</font>
        * He also has an extensive essay of a JSC in action in the materials
          <br>
    * **Meeting Agendas**
        * He provides agendas for first 10 meetings
        * Need to be ruthless when creating your Candidate-Market Fit. Not doing that can slow down your search. 
        * <font color="#f79646">The first 10 agendas walk you and your fellow members through figuring out your Candidate-Market Fit and then starting to network.</font>
          <br>
    * **Next Steps**
        * With JSC, go through creating and reviewing the Mnookin Two-Pager: what you enjoy, must haves, must nots, etc.
        * Listening Tour. Involves 3 types of conversations:
            * <font color="#f79646">Reverse Exit Interviews (Chapter 6)</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">The Golden Question (Chapter 7)</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Recruiter Interviews (Chapter 8)</font>
        * After Listening Tour:
            * Create your Candidate-Market Fit (Chapter 9)
            * Revamp your LinkedIn profile and Resume (Chapter 10)
            * He again emphasizes the emotional challenge of the Listening Tour
            * Listening Tours can open up new possibilities you hadn’t contemplated
        * After you understand and embrace your Candidate-Market Fit
            * Start networking (Chapter 11)
            * How to prepare for and conduct interviews (Chapter 12)


## Step 2: Conduct Your Listening Tour

<br>

### [Chapter 4: The Mnookin Two-Pager](#table-of-contents)



* Listening tour takes 2-3 weeks for out of work job seekers
* Longer if working. Longer if career changer. 
* Emphasizes you continue listening and iterating throughout your job search
* Most people resist doing this b/c it’s tough emotionally
* <font color="#f79646">First Step: Create FIRST DRAFT of your Mnookin Two-Pager</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">what you want, what you love doing and your career goals</font>
* <font color="#f79646">DO NOT NEED TO GET IT EXACTLY RIGHT. IT’S A DRAFT. Special emphasis for me b/c I’m a perfectionist. </font>
* Your Listening Tour should improve your understanding of both what you want and what the market wants
* Not knowing what you want is a very common problem for job searchers. This whole process, which he calls ‘Social Search’ is meant to address this b/c:
    * Kahneman: You can’t see yourself clearly, but others can
    * Learning what’s possible in the job market from others helps you DISCOVER what you want
* Emphasizes again: Be open-minded, curious and not focused on getting leads or interviews
  <br>
* **<font color="#f79646">What’s in The Mnookin Two-Pager. 4 sections:</font>**
    * <font color="#f79646">What you love and hate doing</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Your “must-haves”</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Your “must-nots”</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Your career goals (short-term and long-term)</font>
      <br>
* **What You Hate and Love Doing**
    * It’s always easier to start w/what you _do not want_
    * Mnookin’s: _My idea of hell back then was sitting in an office alone and thinking deep thoughts. So, I included that and clarified that my next step will not be a solo spot or an analytical job. Neither should it be a strategy job that is not about a team. I got joy from seeing stuff implemented._
      <br>
    * **First Exercise: Do this Have/Love paired w/another member of your JSC**
        * Interview each other about what you hate doing.
        * Interview each other about all the kinds of jobs, industries, functions, etc. that you hate and do not love doing. 
        * What about past jobs did you dislike? Why? Your partner should take notes on what you don’t like doing. 
        * Then, in the next steps, you will get the copy of their notes to review it. 
    * <font color="#f79646">Review the list your partner wrote down regarding what YOU hate. </font>
    * Invert this list to inform what you LOVE doing
    * Keep in mind…you can be good at something and not love it
      <br>
* **The Must-Nots Exercise**
    * Pair up w/a DIFFERENT member of your JSC
    * Interview each other about what you do NOT WANT
    * Use the ‘bad bosses’ prompt if your partner has trouble w/this
    * Review your lists w/each other
    * He discusses the value of these INVERSION approaches to finding positive things but starting by articulating the negative. Mentions Munger. 
    * Mentions asking product managers how they’d approach creating a terrible customer experience
    *  If you try to enumerate everything that you do not want (or hate), then you will have clarified some aspects of what you do want or your ‘must haves’.
      <br>
* **Your Must Haves**
    * Most job seekers don’t do this, when it’s critical
    * With the same partner from the Must-Nots Exercise…
        * Review your partner’s Must-Nots
        * Invert the Must Nots into Must Haves
        * Review the first pass of your Must Haves that your partner created for you; make edits or changes
        * Return to your partner and present them with your Must-Haves for discussion and feedback. Go in depth on each item and anything that might be missing. 
          <br>
* **Your Career Goals**
    * Write down both your short-term career goals (your next job) and…
    * Your long-term career goal
    * Don’t worry if you’re not sure
    * Write down 2-3 for each unless you’re crystal clear
      <br>
* Bring your Two-Pager to your next JSC meeting. Share it w/everyone else. Ask for feedback and read everyone else’s. 
* You’re ALMOST ready for your Listening Tour. 

### [Chapter 5: Gratitude House](#table-of-contents)

* Who should you speak to during your Listening Tour?
  <br>
* **Gratitude House**
    * Two points to the exercise:
        * Help you think about who to speak with
        * Improve your confidence and mood
    * Remember people are happy when you ask them for help
    * <font color="#f79646">Steps</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Find a quiet place</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">pen & paper; no screens; no distractions</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Reflect</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Who has helped me along the way? What specifically did they do?</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Make a list</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Names, years, company, team. Other context and details you remember. </font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Write thank-you letters (on paper), but do not send</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">to be sent at the end of your job search</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Writing them improves your state of mind</font>
    * Shows you that you have had a community that have helped you
      <br>
    * **Listening**
        * The goal is to learn from the marketplace how your are perceived and what your fit might be. 
        * This is user research, where you are the product. 
        * <font color="#f79646">The most important thing….LISTEN</font>
        * You don’t need to agree. Listen and attempt to understand. 
        * Be friendly and not defensive. 
        * Not looking for agreement. But understanding. 
          <br>
    * **Follow-Up**
        * **After every conversation:**
            * <font color="#f79646">Send a thank-you note</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Add that person to a regular update</font>
        * **Thank you note:**
            * Cite specifics they mentioned
            * Let them know you’ll keep them updated
        * **Updates**
            * Every month or quarter
            * Updates deepen relationships and strengthens community
            * Can just be simple observations regarding what you’ve figured out (‘a and b but not c’). Doesn’t need to contain amazing information or progress. 
            * Include people in your journey

### [ Chapter 6: Reverse Exit Interviews](#table-of-contents)

* Look at your Gratitude House list. Do you have a former colleague or boss that you worked with either recently or in the last several years?
* <font color="#f79646">Set up time with them. Bring your Mnookin Two-Pager and ask:</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">“What did I do well?”</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">“What could I have done better?”</font>
* <font color="#f79646">Then ask detailed clarifying questions.</font>
* <font color="#f79646">At the end of your Reverse Exit Interview, share your Two-Pager:</font>
    * “<font color="#f79646">What do you think of the Two-Pager?”</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Is it a good description of me? Is it accurate in terms of what I’m good at and enjoy? Anything missing?</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">“What do you think of my short-term career goals?”</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">If there are multiple, which do you think I’m a better fit for? Or areas where there’s greater demand? Or both?</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Anything else in the market - trends or roles - I’d be a fit for?</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">“Who else do you think I should speak with?”</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Use this to expand your network</font>
* Keep a journal w/detailed notes of each conversation
* Thank them at the end of the meeting. Sent a written thank you note. Keep going. 
* Try to do 3-5 of these conversations. 
* <font color="#f79646">Prioritize:</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Those on your Gratitude House List</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Especially those w/stronger networks or you think can be helpful</font>
* This is what David Krauter did
* _CG members will often ask me if they can do these reverse exit interviews even years after leaving a job. The answer is yes._
* Not every conversation will go well. Some may be demoralizing and hit your emotional balance sheet hard.
* Use your JSC to help extract what’s useful and to buck you up
* If one of these interviews changes your thinking, update your Mnookin Two-Pager. 

### [Chapter 7: The Golden Question](#table-of-contents)

* What’s the Golden Question?
* _If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this job search?_
* Not clear to me: Do you also ask this of the Reverse Exit Interview people?
* Recommends 3-5 conversations w/a range of people in your network
* Start w/people on The Gratitude House list
* Include 1-2 people whom you don’t know well
* If you have a small network, ask for introductions to more folks to speak with
* Share what you learn w/your JSC
  <br>
* **Agenda for Golden Question Sessions:**
    * **Context on Yourself**
        * <font color="#f79646">Say something about your career</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">How you’re doing research to understand where there might be opportunities for someone like you</font>
    * **Ask the Golden Question**
        * <font color="#f79646">Don’t say much after asking. Be quiet. Listen. Let them think and reflect. </font>
    * **Share Your Mnookin Two-Pager**
        * <font color="#f79646">Ask the same questions you asked at the end of your Reverse Exit Interviews</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">What do you think of this Two-Pager?</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">What do you think of my short-term career goals?</font>
            * <font color="#f79646">Is there anyone else I should talk to?</font>
              <br>
* Listen. Look for patterns and commonalities across conversations regarding what the market is telling you. Not everything will be correct or applicable. Look for signal in the noise. 
* All these people, across Reverse Exit Interviews and Golden Questions, go on your update list. Some will become ongoing parts of your network and will help you later in your career. 

### [Chapter 8: Recruiters](#table-of-contents)

* Speak with: recruiters and talent partners at VCs and PEs
* He suggests a minimum of 1 recruiter conversation, but ideally 2 or 3
* When you’re in a job, take recruiter calls. Even if you aren’t interested, help them if you can. 
  <br>
* **What to say:**
    * <font color="#f79646">I’m at the beginning of my job search and don’t know exactly what job I want yet. I’d like their advice and input. </font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Like to understand how the market will view me. </font>
      <br>
* **Share your Mnookin Two-Pager and ask, what kind of jobs…**
    * <font color="#f79646">…could I get tomorrow with no effort?</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">…might be possible but would be a stretch?</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">…would be out of my league?</font>
      <br>
* Send thank you notes
* Send periodic updates to everyone you’ve spoken with along the way



## Step 3: Form Your Candidate-Market Fit


<br>

### [Chapter 9: Candidate Market Fit](#table-of-contents)


* <font color="#f79646">You want to align your Candidate-Market Fit with your short-term career goal: Your CMF tells you the type of job you can get w/your current skills and experience → You’ve identified a real market need you can fill. </font>
* When they are aligned, simply follow the remaining steps in the book
* If there’s a disconnect, you must adjust. One of the biggest reasons job seekers don’t find jobs for an extended period is a disconnect. 
* Creating a realistic strategy is possibly the most difficult part of the job search
* Your l/t career goal is NOT a strategy; a strategy is how you get there
* A type of feedback someone received that seems similar to what I might encounter: _“She told me that many had warned her that early-stage startups were not going to value her years of consulting and that her previous startup experience was too long ago and held less credibility.” _
* You need to figure out how to get to the job you want. To do that, you need to know how the job market sees you.
  <br>
* **What you want your Candidate-Market Fit to be:**
    * After your Listening Tour, creating your Candidate-Market Fit should take no more than two weeks if you’re out of work
    * <font color="#f79646">When marketing yourself, you don’t want to present a muddled message with multiple different possibilities. Focus and synchronize everything in your job search.</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">The best CMF statements can be said in a phrase and not more than a sentence</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">These statements put your candidacy in a clear box that provides direction to you, your network and to potential employers about the best jobs for you. (‘clear box’ → you’re the product)</font>
    * Warning: narrowing down your Candidate-Market Fit will likely prove difficult. Most struggle with it. Your intuition will be to cast a wide net. 
    * Your network and members of your JSC will expand your CMF from that narrow statement to a range of jobs. 
    * He says people can be expansive but not reductive: The inverse (extrapolating from a broad CMF to a single candidate job) is not true. They can’t take a wide CMF and boil it down to a single job for you. 
      <br>
* **Examples of good Candidate-Market Fit statements:**
    * Find a Chief of Staff role in a medium-sized financial services institution 
    * Find a VP of Communications role in an artificial intelligence startup with a social mission 
    * Find a VP of Marketing role in a medium-sized, privately held company not backed by venture capital or private equity 
    * Find a VP of Product role in a larger company, and then move into a GM role once inside, and then, after two years, find a COO role in a startup (Andy’s eventual strategy after he failed to find a good COO role) 
    * Find a product manager role in Big Tech, work there for a few years, and then go back out with that new addition to the resume and find a senior-level product role at another tech company 
      <br>

* **Paired Candidate-Market Fit Exercise**
    * **Pair up with a member of your JSC who has also completed their Listening Tour**
    * **Present findings — especially whether your goals and Candidate-Market Fit are in alignment**
            * Your Mnookin Two-Pager
            * Your key career goal
            * Your notes/journal and what you learned about your Candidate-Market Fit. 
            * Include any notes on the disconnect between what you may want (your career goal) and what the market sees for you today.
    * **Brainstorm a one-sentence statement**
            * If you aren’t familiar with some simple brainstorming techniques, then the firm IDEO has some great brainstorming resources online here: https://www.ideou.com/pages/brainstorming (or just search for “IDEO brainstorming”). 
            * If you are meeting with your JSC partner via Zoom, then I also recommend you consider using a tool like Mural, which can make brainstorming easy.
    * **Outline a multi-step strategy if you can’t get to your goal right away**
            * If your goal is out of reach right away, then figure out a multi-step strategy to get there the way that Andy did in the story above.
    * **Switch**
            * Now do the same three steps for the other member.
    * **Bring your potential statements to your next JSC to present**
      <br>
* Avoid fluff, jargon or abstract words
* Sometimes your statement will be multi-part, but more often it will be focused on just the role you’re looking for
* You will know you have a good statement when it’s simple and focused enough for just about anyone to understand 
* If you learn new insights about your CMF, then run those by your JSC to see if they impact your search

### [Chapter 10: LinkedIn/Resume Synch with Candidate-Market Fit](#table-of-contents)

* Your LinkedIn profile and resume are your two most important pieces of marketing collateral, but…
* But only create these AFTER you’ve created your Candidate-Market Fit statement
* Everything on your LI profile and resume MUST align with CMF
- <font color="#f79646">You need to synchronize your skills and experience to the job you are looking for </font>
* **LinkedIn/Resume Rehab Session**
	* Pair up w/a JSC member. 
	* First review each other’s LI profiles. Complete this for one of you and then the other. 
	* Then do the same exercise for your resumes. 
	* So 4 ‘trips’ through this process. 2 of you x (1 resume + 1 LinkedIn)
	* Together, read the example of a LinkedIn Rehab Session below
	* Then share each other’s Candidate-Market Fit statements and Mnookin Two-Pagers
	* Take a quick look at each of your profiles
		* Make general comments; be nice but truthful; don’t be defensive in the other direction
	* Pick one partner to go first
	* Together, go to their profile, and examine each section
		* Go section by section together
		* Ask if:
			* Language reflects CMF?
			* Describe your current job and scope in the plainest language possible
			* Do descriptions of past jobs accurately describe you, your skills/experience? If not, what is missing?
			* Do you have peers whom you respect whose profiles we could look at to compare?
	* Make editing suggestions
		* Use simplest, clearest language
* Make general comments; be nice but truthful; don’t be defensive in the other direction

## Step 4: Create a Job Mission with OKRs when interviewing and negotiating


<br>

### [Chapter 11: Networking](#table-of-contents)

- Says will take 2-8 weeks, depending on:Job Market conditions
	- Quality of your Candidate-Market Fit (CMF) 
	- I’m making this long, b/c I want the details
- You’ll continually update your CMF throughout this process as you learn more with networking. Your CMF just needs to be good enough to start. 
- One purpose of the CMF was to help your network understand you better and find appropriate jobs for you faster
- Your network is a force multiplier to find your opportunities that fit you best
- What you’ve done to strengthen relationships up to this point (i.e. your Listening Tour, thank-you notes and regular updates) and craft your CMF means lots of people can act as ‘listening posts’ for you
  
- Two steps to getting a job:
	- Craft an accurate CMF
	- Network like hell
- Highly recommends Karen Wickre’s _Taking the Working out of Networking_
	- Emphasis on warm introductions 
	  <br>
- **Megibow Dashboard**
	- How to track your networking activity
	- You need to always be doing two things:
		- Setting up new future meetings
		- Conducting meetings
		  <br>
- **5 activities tracked**
	- **Outreach** —<font color="#f79646"> Any email or message initiated by you, including warm and cold introductions, updates, follow-ups, etc., to a recruiter, target company, or networking person, with the intent of supporting your job search. </font>
	- **Scheduled** — <font color="#f79646">Any new meeting with a person in your network, recruiter, or company individual that has been formally scheduled on your calendar. </font>
	- **Networking cal**l — <font color="#f79646">Any call/Zoom meeting/in-person meeting with someone from your Listening Tour, or from your network/industry who is neither a recruiter or at a target company, nor related to active work or consulting. </font>
	- **Recruiter call** — <font color="#f79646">Any call/Zoom/meeting that occurred with an independent recruiter. </font>
	- **Company call** — <font color="#f79646">Any call/Zoom/meeting that occurred with a representative (e.g., board member) or employee at the target company.</font>
- Can get a copy at Phyl.org. It’s a Google Sheet.  
  <br>
- **Jeff’s Opportunity Screener**
	- To help evaluate opportunities against your CMF and your Mnookin Two-Pager
	- Fill out rows  to help figure out what to consider and what to ignore.  
	  <br>
- **Update Your Listening Tour**
	- Reach out to:
		- People you identified during your Gratitude House exercise
		- People you ended up meeting during your Listening Tour
		  <br>
- Main difference between these conversations and those earlier ones: You have a strategy and a focus
- You’ll use the Golden Question again, but in a new way. You’ll ask for information on networking groups and anyone in their networks who can help you find a job. 
  <br>
- **Steps:**
	- **Send an end-of-listening-tour update/request for another conversation**
		- Thank them again; tell them about your CMF and if you could arrange another phone call or coffee
	- **When you meet . . . **
		- Thank them; reiterate your strategy
		- Ask the Golden Question again, but a different one: _<font color="#f79646">“If this were your Candidate-Market Fit, how would you approach finding such a job if you were in my shoes?”</font>_ 
	- **Be curious and open-minded**
		- Ask follow-up questions to better understand their answers. Peel the onion a bit. 
		- Don’t ask questions to drive agreement. Ask questions to understand what they’re suggesting. 
	- **Ask them for any networking groups they think you should join**
		- Industry associations, online groups, etc. relevant to your Candidate-Market Fit
		- Any student/alumni job-placement/assistance services. 
	- **Ask them for people they think you should talk to**
		- With anyone they refer, ask if they can make a warm introduction
	- **Ask them to act as a listening post**
		- With a clear CMF clearly articulated, it’s easier for them to keep you top of mind
	- **Ask them about target companies**
		- Ask them to help you build a target list of companies that align to your Mnookin Two-Pager and your Candidate-Market Fit. 	 
		  <br>
- **Target Companies**
	- <font color="#f79646">Create a list of target companies that align with what you’re looking for</font>
	- Use the process above to add (and subtract) companies to that list  
	  
	  <br>
	  
- **Join Every Relevant Networking Group**
  
	- join every relevant-to-your-strategy networking group on Slack, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, etc. or IRL!
	- There are even old-fashioned ones that meet in real life.
	- Use college services. Most colleges now have free online and offline job placement services for alumni
	- Subscribe to TheLadders and/or ExerThread or anything suggested by your JSC or through your conversations 
	  
	  <br>
- **The Art of Asking for Warm Introductions**
	- **<font color="#f79646">Ask the introducer to ask the third party first (and do not cc you)</font>**
	- <font color="#f79646">I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THIS. MARTIN INTRODUCED ME TO IT. IT’S HUGE. </font>
	- Optionally, offer to draft a note that they can edit as they see fit 
		- (To relieve them of some of the work.)
		- Say, “I won’t get your voice right and they should edit it, but wanted to give them something to work from.”
	- Ask the introducer to connect you once the third party says yet 
	- Other stuff from this section:
		- A VC said: “If I get the usual “I want to work with smart people at an interesting company doing something in marketing,”, then i’m not interested. 
		- If the introducer doesn’t want to make a warm intro, suggest it’s typically more effective, but you’ll follow their lead.  
		  
		  <br>
- **The Art of Reaching Out Cold**
	- If you want to speak w/someone, but you have no one to introduce you
	- Expect very low success rates
	- **Level 1 of Cold Outreach: **
		- Less effective, but less work
			- Suggests the following approach:
			- <font color="#f79646">Know what’s important to the person</font>
				- Learning something about them and what they care about and use it in your outreach
				- Attention to detail is appreciated
			- <font color="#f79646">Be Curious</font>
				- Don’t make assumptions, but make a discovery
			- <font color="#f79646">Be playful</font>
				- Ask an open ended question starting w/How? or Why? Take a chance. 
	- **Level 2 of Cold Outreach**
		- More effective, but more work
		- Figure out what’s important to the person you want to meet and then be proactively helpful to them.
		- Wickre in her book and Adam Grant called ‘a 5-minute favor’
		- Look for things that would be helpful for others, meaningful but easy for him
		- _I started listening closely to people and thinking about what matters to them and how I can help them — whether through an introduction, sending them a link to research, or other simple-for-me-to-do favors that matter to them._
		  <br>
- **<font color="#f79646">And certainly, no matter what you do, follow up.</font>**
- **<font color="#f79646">Follow-Up</font>**
	- He mentioned this before: People are inconsistent w/their thank-you notes and often negligent in providing regular monthly or quarterly updates to those they’ve met with
	- The whole point of all this is to be relational. (Build/develop relationships.)
	- This is not just about getting a job. It’s about building friendships and trust and a village of support around you. It’s about tending your garden of relationships
	- **<font color="#f79646">Rules of Follow-up</font>**
		- **<font color="#f79646">Send a thank-you note after each networking session</font>**
			-<font color="#f79646"> Be specific about something they said</font>
		- **<font color="#f79646">Send a regular update</font>**
			- <font color="#f79646">Monthly or Quarterly</font>
			- <font color="#f79646">Doesn’t have to be groundbreaking</font>
		- **<font color="#f79646">When you do get a job, tell them, and thank them for their help</font>**
			- <font color="#f79646">Reach out individually to everyone</font>
	- THIS NEVER STOPS DURING YOUR CAREER OR WHEN YOU START WORKING. STAY INVOLVED. HELP OTHERS. LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING.  
	  <br>
- **Keep Iterating**
	- As you learn more while networking, fine-tune and update your CMF. 
	- Listen for trends, nuances, phrases/words, changes in the market that might impact your CMF 
	  <br>
	  
- ***<font color="#f79646">The worst thing to do is to present yourself as someone who could do a range of things depending on what a company needs.</font>***


### [Chapter 12: Interviewing](#table-of-contents)


- Interviewing them as much as they interview you
- He wants you to ‘boss the process’. Control it. 
- Leverage your Job Mission with OKRs tool is key 
<br>

- **Create a Job Mission**
	- Draft a Job Mission with OKRs tool (OKR = Objectives and Key Results)
	- Do it yourself. Use it to surface good interview questions.
	- Good questions -> deepen your understanding of the role + impress the interviewer
	- If you go through several rounds w/the hiring manager, but before you get an offer, request a meeting w/the hiring manager
	- Tell them you want to make sure you understand the role correctly
	- Walk them through your Job Mission with OKRs document:
		- Did I leave something out?
		- Did I over or underemphasize anything?
	- Says it will impress them and increase your odds of getting an offer
	- You also use your Job Mission with OKRs to negotiate compensation, resources, budget and support
	- Says this is one of the best tools in the book
	- But most people don’t use it
	- He has a video of someone talking about it w/their actual JM w/OKRs document 
	  <br>

- **How to Create a Job Mission**
	- Download and Read the Job Mission w/OKRs Examples Document
	- Start drafting it as soon as you begin interviews
	- Identify questions
	- Ask for feedback from your JSC and anyone relevant in your network
	- Present to your hiring manager BEFORE you get an offer 
	  <br>

- **Research**

	- Review 10K, especially Management Discussion and Analysis
	- Look at activity section of company executive’s LI profiles as well as any podcasts (e.g. CEO discussing their strategy), blog posts, interviews, etc.
	- Look for bad strategy, products and culture 
	  <br>

- **Bad Products**
	- Once you begin interviewing, you can ask for access to their products
	- Review it qualitatively (e.g. what works, what doesn’t, what’s frustrating, what’s great)
	- Quantitatively (e.g. usage statistics, revenue/financial metrics)
	- If they have a website or mobile app, use them
	- Use this review to inform your questions 
	  <br>

- **Bad Strategy**

	- Read Chapter 3 of Richard Rumelt’s Good Strategy/Bad Strategy
	- 4 signs of bad strategy:
	- Fluff/Jargon/Trendy. Should be clear and direct.
	- Lack recognition of the challenge(s). 
	- Mistaking goals for strategy. State audacious goals without discussing how they’ll do it. 
	- Bad strategic objectives.  
	- Ask your JSC for feedback on your research. Avoid bad cultures, especially.  
	  <br>
	  
- **Bad Culture**

	- Listen to your own reactions. 
	- Pay attention to everything. Are they humble? arrogant? Corporate generic and bureaucratic?
	- Bezos’ annual letter. Emphasizes customers and not employees. Meaningful cultural information. 
	- Is the culture insular? Are the employee networked w/in the industry? (Conny w/Yelp)
	- [The Muse Article: 9 Sneaky Ways to Figure Out a Company’s Culture](https://www.themuse.com/advice/9-sneaky-ways-to-figure-out-a-companys-culture) 
	  <br>

- **Backchannel Research**

	- Use your expanded network and the network of your JSC
	- Let your JSC find red flags you might’ve missed
	- Talk to as many people as you can about the company, its culture and the people you’ll be working with
	- Find out what motivates the founder(s) if going to a startup
	- Question to ask: _<font color="#f79646">If I called and left a voicemail and told you I was considering working for this company (and/or this person), and said please call me back only if you feel strongly that I must go work there . . . would you have called me back? Why or why not?</font>_
	- Dig. Ask follow up questions of the people you’re using for research. They’re intense? How do you mean?
	  <br>
  

- **Paired Interview Preparation**

	- Be prepared for likely questions from them
	- Have good questions for them to help you understand the role and your fit
	- **<font color="#f79646">How the paired interview exercise works:</font>**
		- Pair up w/a fellow JSC member who is also interviewing
		- Share key artifacts
			- job description, your Candidate-Market Fit, LI profile, resume and anything uncovered during your research, your Mnookin Two-Pager
		- Spend 15–20 minutes reading your partner’s artifacts
			- write down 1st impressions of the company
			- Questions you would both answer and ask
		- Share first impressions
			- impressions of company, thoughts, concerns
		- Write down interview questions for your partner
			- Based on must-haves, must-nots, anything else that surfaced. (These are questions for your partner to direct towards the employer.)
			- Answer these questions:
				- 1) if you were the potential employer, what questions would you want to ask your partner? and 
				- 2) if you were the job candidate, what would you want to ask the potential employer? 
		
		- Share your questions with each other
			- Discuss and edit so you develop a single list of PRIORITIZED questions to answer and ask
		
		- Practice interviewing
			- practice!, practice!, practice! 
			  <br>

- **Sample Questions:**
	- Page 171-173
	- Topic areas:
		- Role
		- Strategy
		- Product, Customer and Market
		- Culture
		- Reflections on Fit
	- The Ladders has good lists of interview questions 
	  <br>


- **What to Do Right Before You Interview**
	- Review your Gratitude List; think about everyone that helped you 
	  <br>


- **Listen to What They Do**
	- Biggest mistake he sees: Candidates replace reality w/wish fulfillment. Don’t see things as they are. 
	- Use your eyes, ears and social cues to see what’s right in front of you. 
	- Pay attention to how the interview acts
	- This is the best treatment you’ll ever get from the company. If they don’t treat you well then, then…? 
	  <br>

- **Post-Interview Debrief**

	- Don’t get swept up in the excitement of the possibility of getting a job
	- This takes a few hours
	- Have a JSC member take you through the questions on page 178-180
	- Topics:
		- Culture/Personality
		- Relevant Knowledge and Expertise
		- Were you uncomfortable with anything you can’t put your finger on?



## Step 5: Negotiate and Prepare to Start


<br>

### [Chapter 13: Negotiating Salary](#table-of-contents)


* **_<font color="#f79646">The key is to have the courage to ask</font>_**
* 83% of the time, you’ll get more than you were initially offered
* Your prior work, which includes vetting your Job Mission with OKRs by the hiring manager should increase their interest in you
* Additionally, if you negotiate for the budget, resources and support you’ll need to succeed, that should also increase their interest in hiring you 
  <br>

* **Manage the Recruiter**
    * The most important thing to remember is that your goal is to NOT do the recruiter’s job
    * Most recruiters are like real estate agents. They want to close you quickly, not get you top dollar. 
    * That said, it’s still important to cultivate and work closely with recruiters. They are not your friends or your JSC, but you should still keep them close. 
    * <font color="#f79646"> Make the recruiter your partner</font>
    * <font color="#f79646">The best recruiters do this, but if they don’t proactively support you, ask them for as much help and coaching as you need. </font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Ask them to prepare you so you can do your best. </font>
    * <font color="#f79646">Share the questions you have prepared to answer and ask them if they would add any. </font> 
      <br>

* **Salary Negotiations Preparations**
    * If you need a boost…don’t think of negotiating on behalf of yourself, but rather, for your family 
      <br>

* **Salary Exercise you should do before you start negotiating**
    * (begins on page 193)
    * **<font color="#f79646">Outline all the compensation elements in the offer</font>**
        * Base salary, bonus (and what it’s tied to), Equity, Signing bonus, Retirement plan (do they make contributions, how much, etc.), Healthcare benefits (insurance plan, options, out of pocket premiums, etc.), Vacation/time-off
    * **<font color="#f79646">Read Chapter 5 of Women Don’t Ask</font>**
    * **<font color="#f79646">Ask Around</font>**
        * Do research
        * Speak to the recruiter working with you and see if they have access to industry pay benchmarks
        * Call recruiters you don’t know and see if they can help
        * Several companies like Robert Half International have salary calculators
        * Glassdoor has something call the Know Your Worth tool
        * If you interview w/a venture backed company, see if you can access the VCECS (The Venture Capital Executive Compensation Survey). See if you know anyone w/access to it. 
    * **<font color="#f79646">Think about your deal-breaker minimums</font>**
        * Know what your minimum cash and equity are
    * **<font color="#f79646">Think about anything else related to compensation</font>**
        * non-salary ways you can be compensated (moving costs, remote work, student-loan debt assistance, tuition reimbursement, credit assistance, HSAs, 401, more vacation days, etc.)
    * **<font color="#f79646">Consult your JSC</font> **
        * Ask for their opinions and get their feedback 



### [Chapter 14: Negotiating What You Need to Succeed](#table-of-contents)

* Do not skip negotiating the budget, resources and support you will need to succeed in your new role
* This makes your more likely to succeed in the new role and give you a leg up on getting promoted
* It also impresses your prospective employer that you’re invested enough to think about all the required elements of the job
* People are scared to ask.They shouldn’t be. 
* They have a bunch of items in this chapter that could constitute support: mentorship from the CEO, board prep coaching, education, funding for a team or project, executive coaching, getting your on boards of directors
* 17% of people who ask don’t get what they want, in terms of compensation
* He says, though they often get much of what they ask for 
  <br>


* <font color="#f79646">How to figure out what you need to succeed:</font>
* **<font color="#f79646">What You’ll Need to Succeed Exercise</font>**
    * <font color="#f79646">Review</font> **<font color="#f79646">Job Mission with Examples</font>** <font color="#f79646">download from Phyl.org in Chapter 12.</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Review examples of how CG members integrated their Job Mission with OKRs with the budget, resources, and support needed to achieve those objectives and key results.</font>

    * <font color="#f79646">Show to your hiring manager</font>
        * <font color="#f79646">Ask them for this to get the support you need </font>
          <br>

* **Starter Questions (an abbreviated selection of a much longer set of lists in the book)**
    * **Budget**
        * How much budget do I need to accomplish these OKRs? 
        * What kind of team do I need?
        * Are there new systems/processes/tools that need to be built or purchases?
    * **Resources**
        * Do I need a dedicated internal recruiter?
        * Do I need access to external resources the company has on retainer?
    * **Support**	
        * What mentoring from my boss or boss’s boss do I need to come up to speed quickly on this new industry, function, business? 
        * What training or professional development do I or my team need? 
        * What industry groups or associations, peer councils, etc. do I need 
        * Do I need an executive coach? 
          <br>
* Get these commitments of Budget, Resources and Support in writing
* Integrate into the offer letter
* Each step of the negotiation, ask your JSC and others for help

      <br>

* **How to Set Up a First 90 Days PCC**
    * If someone you ask isn’t immediately interested, move onto another target
    * Ask a member of your JSC to moderate this call

    * Give back. Help others. 
    * Consider converting your JSC into a Career Council to keep supporting each other 
      

### [Chapter 16: The Last Word](#table-of-contents)

- Highlight two books that highlight leaders exhibiting humility and asking for help:
	- Built to Last (1994) by Jim Collins
	- Jerry Porras and Good to Great, also by Collins (2001).
- Re-emphasizes how 'mutually reinforcing activity' (not searching alone) helps bridge the gap between *knowing what to do* and *doing it*.
