* #### Step 1: Form a Job Search Council (Chapters 1 - 3)
    * Provide emotional support, advice and feedback.
    * Also get the benefit of their networks 

* #### Step 2: Conduct a Listening Tour **Before** You Begin Networking and Interviewing (Chapters 4 - 8)
    * Emotionally difficult/challenging
    * Be open-minded, creative and curious
    * *Get out there and understand how the market sees you, what the opportunities are, and what you want*

* #### Step 3: Form your Candidate-Market Fit (Chapters 9 - 10)
    * Once you have completed your self-discovery and market research, then I recommend you create a concise Candidate-Market Fit.
    * _In other words, I ask that you put yourself in a clear, marketable box._
    * Don’t make the mistake of being “open” to a wide range of offers. Narrow your focus. 
    * Once you do, then you can transition to where others start their job searches: with networking and interviewing.

* #### Step 4: Create a Job Mission with OKRs when interviewing and negotiating (Chapters 12 - 14)
    * Once you start to get serious with a potential employer (but before you finish interviewing), create a Job Mission with OKRs. 
    * Will impress your potential employer
    * Create alignment about the role
    * Set you up to negotiate the money and the resources and support you’ll need to succeed.

* #### Step 5: Negotiate for Budget, Resources, and Support (Chapter 14)
    * 4 Legs of the Negotiation ‘Stool’
        * Salary
        * Budget
        * Resources
        * Support
    * Many people do not negotiate salary, but almost none negotiate the budget, resources, and support they’ll need to succeed.
    * This may be the single most important tactical tip in the whole book. 
    * I say that because, if you set yourself up for success, then, you can improve the odds of doing well in the new role, thereby creating the possibility for gratification and joy, not to mention promotions, raises, and new offers down the road.
